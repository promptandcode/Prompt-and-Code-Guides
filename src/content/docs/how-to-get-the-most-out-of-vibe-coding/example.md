## 🎯 What is Vibe Coding?

- Vibe coding means programming with natural language using AI.
- You treat the AI as your coding partner — giving it structured, detailed prompts.
- It's a rapid evolution of prompt engineering with powerful potential.

---

## 🛠 Plan Before Coding

- Always start with a **comprehensive plan**.
- Use a markdown file to outline the system architecture.
- Break down the project into parts and clearly mark things that are out of scope (e.g., "later").

---

## 🔄 Version Control is Essential

- Use Git consistently: commit working changes regularly.
- Use `git reset --hard` when you need a clean slate.
- Don't let AI output pile up without structure.

---

## ✅ Prioritize High-Level Testing

- Write integration tests **before** adding features.
- Testing early helps catch side effects from AI-generated code.

---

## 🧩 Use Modularity and Refactor

- Keep your codebase **modular** with small, focused files.
- Define clear API boundaries between components.
- Once tests are in place, you can safely ask the AI to refactor.

---

## 🧰 Choose the Right Tools

- For beginners: tools like **Replit** or **Lovable** focus on UI and simplicity.
- For more control: try **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, or **Windsurf**.
- If stuck in an IDE, try using the AI directly through a prompt interface.

---

## 🎙 Multimodal Context Helps

- Use screenshots or diagrams when explaining UI/design issues to AI.
- Tools with voice input (like Aqua) can help you generate prompts faster.

---

## 🐞 Smart Bug Fixing

- Paste error messages directly into your prompt.
- First, ask the AI for **possible causes**, not just code fixes.
- Reset and add logging when things get too messy.

---

## 🔍 Choose Your Stack Strategically

- AI understands mature frameworks (like **Ruby on Rails**) better.
- Cutting-edge stacks (like **Rust** or **Elixir**) may give less reliable outputs — though this is improving.

---

## 📈 Iterate and Experiment

- Different models excel at different tasks:
  - Use **Gemini** for high-level planning.
  - Use **Claude Sonnet** for code implementation.
- Continuously test new tools and models.

---

## 💬 Community Tips

> "Make a plan with AI before coding. Save it as a markdown doc. Label stuff you're avoiding as 'not today, Satan'."

> "Commit every time something works. No exceptions. Don't trust the undo button. Tests = mental seatbelts."

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

Vibe coding isn't just using AI — it's a structured, collaborative process.  
To get the most out of it:

- Plan thoroughly  
- Use version control  
- Write tests  
- Keep code modular  
- Experiment with tools  

Adopt solid engineering practices, and AI will multiply your speed and effectiveness.
