🛠️ Guide: Using v0.dev to Build Production-Ready Apps (End-to-End)
Overview
This guide covers how to use v0.dev, Vercel’s generative UI tool, to build high-quality internal tools or customer-facing apps—solo or in a small team.
Includes:
✅ AI-optimized PRDs,
✅ UI/feature development prompts,
✅ QA processes,
✅ Deployment & scaling best practices.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js 13+ App Router

Backend: Supabase (Auth/DB)

Deployment: Vercel

Optional: Figma

v0.dev generates React/Tailwind UI code (Shadcn/UI by default).

1️⃣ Ideation & Planning
Steps
✅ Define Product Vision
Example: “Internal Inventory Dashboard for Ops – search products, edit stock, view low-stock alerts.”

✅ Draft PRD (AI-friendly & concise):

Section	Details
Title	Inventory Dashboard
Problem	Ops team lacks real-time inventory visibility.
Users	Ops Managers (primary)
Key Features	Login, Inventory table, Edit modal, Low-stock alert
Non-functional	Responsive design, company colors
Metrics	Reduce out-of-stock events by 30%
✅ Use AI Tools

ChatGPT/ChatPRD to draft PRDs/user stories.

v0.dev for component breakdowns: Prompt: “My app: Inventory Dashboard, login, searchable table, edit modal. What UI components do I need?”

✅ Backend Planning

Set up Supabase project (schema, RLS, API keys).

v0.dev connects UI to Supabase but doesn’t create databases.

2️⃣ Prototyping UI with v0.dev
Workflows
A. Text Prompts
B. Figma Imports (Optional)
C. Image-to-UI (Optional)

Example Prompts
“Create a Next.js page for Inventory Dashboard: header, search, table (Name, SKU, Quantity). Modern design.”

“Add a sidebar with links: Dashboard, Products, Settings.”

“Use Shadcn button, primary color blue #1E40AF.”

“Make table responsive; add zebra striping.”

Tips
✅ Start simple, iterate 1 change at a time
✅ Export regularly, keep code in Git
✅ Use component-by-component generation
✅ Ask for design variations
✅ Attach images/screenshots for complex layouts
✅ Figma import → modular frames recommended.

3️⃣ Feature Development & Integration
Authentication
“Implement login using Supabase Auth (email/password). Redirect on success.”

“Add Google OAuth login via Supabase.”

CRUD
“Connect inventory table to Supabase products table. Fetch and display products.”

“Implement EditProductModal to update product in Supabase.”

Search/Filter
“Implement client-side search by product name.”

“Highlight rows where Quantity < 5 in red.”

Advanced Prompts
“Use Zustand for global state management for products.”

“Create API route /api/reports for low-stock products.”

“Add a bar chart (Recharts) for stock by category.”

Debug Example
“Inventory doesn’t refresh after edit. Here’s code… What’s wrong?” v0 identifies missing state updates/fixes.

4️⃣ UI Review & Refinement
Design Consistency
“Make all buttons Shadcn primary style, full-width mobile.”

“Add Lucide icons to Delete buttons.”

“Responsive layout: tables scroll horizontally on mobile.”

Accessibility
“Add alt text to images and form labels.”

Run Lighthouse Accessibility Audit.

UX Copy
“Change error: ‘Invalid input’ → ‘Please fill required fields’.”

“Add loading spinner on Save button.”

AI UX Review
Upload screenshots to ChatGPT Vision → Prompt: “Review UI for spacing, contrast, alignment.”

5️⃣ QA & Testing
Manual Tests
✅ Login, CRUD, search
✅ Edge cases: empty fields, large data sets

Unit Tests
“Write Jest tests for InventoryTable (search, filter).”

Performance
Run Lighthouse, fix slow load

“Optimize table for 1000+ rows: paginate, lazy load.”

Security
Review Supabase RLS

“Allow only Managers to edit products.”

npm audit for vulnerabilities

Ensure env vars, no secrets in code

Bug Fixing
“Fix bug: inventory not updating after add.”

Use v0 for debugging + code fixes

6️⃣ Deployment & Scaling
Vercel Deployment
✅ v0.dev → 1-click deploy (preview/demo)
✅ For production → Export code → GitHub → Vercel CI/CD
✅ Use Vercel env vars for secrets

Scaling Best Practices
Shadcn/UI + Tailwind Design System

Extract components → shared libraries

Zustand/Redux for state

Next.js App Router → app/(dashboard)/inventory/page.tsx

Document architecture + README

Use Sentry for error logging (optional)

7️⃣ Prompt Templates (Quick Reference)
Type	Example
Ideation	“List components/pages for an Inventory Dashboard app.”
PRD Draft	“Draft PRD for internal tool: product stock management.”
UI	“Create dashboard page: header, sidebar, main content.”
Feature	“Implement CRUD for products table via Supabase.”
Testing	“Write Jest tests for EditProductModal validations.”
QA	“Generate QA checklist for app: accessibility, errors.”
Scaling	“Refactor state to use Zustand global store.”
Debug	“Fix error: modal not closing after save.”
Performance	“Optimize table for large data sets (pagination).”
